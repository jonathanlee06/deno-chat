# Deno-Chat :sauropod:
This repo is an attempt to learn Deno by myself. ` deno-chat ` is a simple real-time chat application written in TypeScript utilizing Deno and Websockets

## Installation
Before you start, you need to have [Deno installed](https://deno.land/#installation) in order to run this application locally

1. Clone this project to your desired location
2. Open a terminal in the root directory of the project folder
3. Run `deno run --allow-net --allow-read server.ts` in the terminal
4. Open `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser to use at the first client
5. Open second instance of `http://localhost:3000/` to see real-time chat between 2 users
